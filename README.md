# graph-visualizer

Graph visualizer is used to visualize different path finding algorithm and the shortest path between source and destination.

You can visit : https://ghosttman.github.io/graph-visualizer to use this tool for visualizing graph algorithm.

# Algorithms Used 

1. Breadth First Search : Breadth First Search (BFS) used to find the shortest path from source to any destination. 
2. Bidirectional Search : Used to find the shortest path between source and destination. 
3. Flood Fill : Flood fill used to find any path between source and destination. it doesn't ensure that the path is shortest.

# How To Use

1. Add source node : To add source node you need to click on "Add Start Point" button and click on cell to choose the cell as source node. You can select single cell as a source node at a time.
2. Remove source node : To remove again click on "Add Start Point" if already not clicked then click on the cell that was selected as a source node before.

3. Add Destination :  To add destination node you need to click on "Add End Point" button and click on cell to choose the cell as Destination node. You can select single cell or multiple cell as a destination node.
4. Remove Destination : To remove again click on "Add End Point" if already not clicked then click on the cell that was selected as a destination node before.

4. Add / Remove obstacle : Click on "Add Obstacle" button then clicked and hold on mouse button and move cursor over cell if any cell doesn't have any obstacle it will add obstacle otherwise remove the existing one.

5. Select Algorithm : click on "Select Algorithm" and choose your preferable algorithm and click on the button below it to visualize.
