# graph-visualizer

Graph visualizer is used to visualize different path finding algorithm and the shortest path between source and destination.

You can visit : https://ghosttman.github.io/graph-visualizer to use this tool for visualizing graph algorithm.

# Algorithms Used 

1. Breadth First Search : Breadth First Search (BFS) used to find the shortest path from source to any destination. 
2. Bidirectional Search : Used to find the shortest path between source and destination. 
3. Flood Fill : Flood fill used to find any path between source and destination. it doesn't ensure that the path is shortest.
